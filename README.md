[![Built with the Deno Standard Library](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built_with_std-black?logo=deno)](https://jsr.io/@std)

My personal blog where I share my technical posts.

## Getting Started

```bash
deno i --allow-scripts
deno task dev
```

Or for a production preview:

```bash
deno task start
```

As you can see you will need to have installed the `deno` toolchain in order to run the project
(find it in [deno.com](https://deno.com/)).
